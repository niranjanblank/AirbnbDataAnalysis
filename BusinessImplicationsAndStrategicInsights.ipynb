    "### Finding 1: Geographical Factors and Price\n",
    "It was found that geographical factors like _longitude_, _latitude_ and _neighbourhood_group_, has a significant impact on the price. These geographical variables are interconnected. For example, _neighbourhood_group_ is a categorical representation of geographical areas, and _latitude_ and _longitude_ provide\n",
    "the precise location within these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "From out data analysis, we found that Manhattan neighbourhood group had higher prices. This suggests that listings in popular locations, like Manhattan, can command higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "This insight could be valuable for hosts when setting their pricing strategies. They could consider location as a significant factor, particularly if their properties are located in popular regions like Manhattan. On the other hand, guests looking for more budget-friendly options might want to consider listings that are located in less popular regions like Queens or Bronx.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: Influence of Room Type\n",
    "Our machine learning model and data analysis showed that the room type was a significant factor in determining the listing price. Specially, _Entire home/apt_ and _Hotel room_ types were generally associated with higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "For hosts, this information can guide their rental strategy. If their circumstances allow, they could consider providing entire apartments or homes for rent to maximize their income. For guests, this insight can help manage their budgeting expectations based on the room type they prefer to book.\n"
