    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss the insights gained from our data analysis and machine learning model. We have examined a wide variety of features of Airbnb listings in New York City, including their locations, room types, minimum nights, number of reviews, availability, and price. These analyses have provided a wealth of insights that can inform strategies for hosts, guests, and Airbnb as a platform. We will discuss these insights and their implications in detail in this section."

    "## Key Findings and Business Insights\n",
    "### Finding 1: Geographical Factors and Price\n",
    "It was found that geographical factors like _longitude_, _latitude_ and _neighbourhood_group_, has a significant impact on the price. These geographical variables are interconnected. For example, _neighbourhood_group_ is a categorical representation of geographical areas, and _latitude_ and _longitude_ provide\n",
    "the precise location within these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "From out data analysis, we found that Manhattan neighbourhood group had higher prices. This suggests that listings in popular locations, like Manhattan, can command higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "This insight could be valuable for hosts when setting their pricing strategies. They could consider location as a significant factor, particularly if their properties are located in popular regions like Manhattan. On the other hand, guests looking for more budget-friendly options might want to consider listings that are located in less popular regions like Queens or Bronx.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: Influence of Room Type\n",
    "Our machine learning model and data analysis showed that the room type was a significant factor in determining the listing price. Specially, _Entire home/apt_ and _Hotel room_ types were generally associated with higher prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "For hosts, this information can guide their rental strategy. If their circumstances allow, they could consider providing entire apartments or homes for rent to maximize their income. For guests, this insight can help manage their budgeting expectations based on the room type they prefer to book.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 3: Year-round Availability\n",
    "Our analysis revealed that some listings are available all year round (365 days), while others are only available for a limited time throughout the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "For hosts, understanding the typical availability periods could help in planning their hosting strategy. If most listings are available year-round, this could imply a stable demand throughout the year. On the other hand, if many listings  are only available for a part of the year, this could indicate a seasonality pattern in demand. For guests, understanding these patterns could be helpful in planning their trips. For instance, if a destination has fewer available listings at certain times of the year, it might be better to plan their visit during off-peak periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 4: Influence of Reviews\n",
    "Our analysis showed that the number of reviews doesn't significantly impact the price of the listing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "This could indicate that guests do not necessarily prioritize highly-reviewed listings, which may be because of factors such as location, amenities, or listing type taking precedence. For new hosts, this could be encouraging as they can still competitively price their listings without a large number of reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 5: Multiple Listings and Price\n",
    "Our statistical tests revealed a significant difference in prices between hosts who have multiple listings and those who only have one. Surprisingly, host with a single listing tend to price their properties higher on average.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Business Implication\n",
    "This could be useful information for both hosts and guests. Hosts with single listings might be pricing their properties higher due to less competition or a unique offering that allows them to command their higher prices. Alternatively, hosts with multiple listings might be pricing their properties more competitively to ensure occupancy across all their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For guests, this could be something to consider when selecting a property. They might find that hosts with multiple listings provide a more professional service at a more affordable price, while hosts with single lilstings may offer a unique or premium experience that could justify the higher price.\n",
